1. Copy BRAmaRecipes to <mission>\ExAdClient\XM8\Apps
2. Add the following to CfgXM8 that was defined for ExAd:

	class BRAmaRecipes 
	{
		controlID = 107000;
		title = "Recipies";		
		logo = "ExAdClient\XM8\Apps\BRAmaRecipes\BRAma.paa";
		config = "ExAdClient\XM8\Apps\BRAmaRecipes\config.sqf";
		onLoad = "ExAdClient\XM8\Apps\BRAmaRecipes\onLoad.sqf";
		onOpen = "ExAdClient\XM8\Apps\BRAmaRecipes\onOpen.sqf";
	};

3. Add "BRAmaRecipes" to the extraApps[] array defined in CfgXM8 
4. If you put the BRAmaRecipes in a different folder than specified in #1, change the variable BRAmaRecipesPath in config.sqf to point to the location you chose, follow the example alread at the top of that file.

If you have installed ExAd properly, this will work out of the box.
