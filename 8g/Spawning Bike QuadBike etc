So,

Users in the forum down below asked for help, so I decided to show it. Maybe you will need it too.

This is what you need if you want a player to spawn... eerr...request a bike/quad bike or any other vehicle on spawn.

mpmissions/your.pbo/init.sqf

//TO BE USED ONLY ON SERVER
if (isDedicated || isServer) then {
	"do_MakeBike" addPublicVariableEventHandler {
		_parameters = (_this select 1);
		_parameters2  =(_parameters select 1);
		diag_log format ["createVehicleRequested %1 ", _parameters]; // YOU NEED THIS FOR LOGS TO SEE WHO DID IT
		veh = createVehicle["Exile_Bike_MountainBike", _parameters2 , [] ,0 , "NONE"];
	};
};
mpmissions/your.pbo/spawn_bike.sqf (you can put it anywhere you want, just alter the path)

if !((vehicle player) isEqualTo player) exitWith {}; //MAKE SURE WE ARE ON FEET

//We check if we have money for that
if (ExileClientPlayerMoney > 500) then {
    titleText ["", "PLAIN DOWN"];
    player playActionNow "Medic"; //ANIMATED DELAY
    player removeAction DeployBikeAction; //REMOVE TO LET PLAYER SPAWN BIKES DURING THE PLAY
    _spawnPos = player modelToWorld [0,2,0];
    _spawnDir = (getDir player) -90;
    do_MakeBike = [player, _spawnPos, _spawnDir];
    ExileClientPlayerMoney = ExileClientPlayerMoney - 500; //REMOVE THE MONEY
    uiSleep 3;
    publicVariableServer "do_MakeBike"; //HEY SERVER GIVE ME A BIKE
    uiSleep 1;
    ['BIKE DEPLOYED',0,0.6,2,0] spawn bis_fnc_dynamictext;
};
 

edit config.cpp to include, you need to override default client function to add your new menu entry

class CfgExileCustomCode 
{
    	ExileClient_object_player_bambiStateBegin = "ExileClient_object_player_bambiStateBegin.sqf";
};
 

put ExileClient_object_player_bambiStateBegin.sqf from exile client to your mpmission folder and edit it
