*DISCLAIMER* This is not my script. The owner of this script is unknown.

This script will allow your players to respawn at their bases upon death. Any base the player has building rights to can be utilized as a spawn point. Unfortunately this is not compatible with xSpawn as they both replace the same Exile function.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: DePbo your map (i.e. Exile.Altis).

Step 2: Create a folder and name it "Custom". (Disregard if you already have one)

Step 3: Place the "baserespawn.sqf" into the "Custom" folder.

Step 4: Inside of your "config.cpp" add the following line to your "class cfgExileCustomCode":

//Base Respawn (Can't use with xSpawn)
ExileClient_gui_selectSpawnLocation_show = "Custom\baserespawn.sqf";
Step 5: RePbo your map and upload.
