Thanks go to Sa-Matra for the initial code fix from King of the Hill. I have altered it to work in Exile mod

Grab the files from GitHub https://github.com/MGTDB/Exile_Block_Floor_Peeking

Add the contents of initPlayerLocal to your initPlayerLocal file at the top below 

if (!hasInterface || isServer) exitWith {};
Create a new folder called addons, within that folder create a new folder called fixes  (unless you already have them) or alter paths in calls to your mission file requirements
Add the 2 files in addons/fixes, or edit your existing files if already custom and add the contents of

class CfgExileCustomCode
Into that code block in mission.cpp (or .hpp)

Pack mission file
