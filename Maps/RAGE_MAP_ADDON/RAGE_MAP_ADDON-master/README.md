# RAGE_MAP_ADDON

# What is it?

It is a server addon that adds lootable buildings and other map objects to your ARMA 3 EXILE server.

Actually, it will work on any ARMA 3 server.

# How does it work?

It's a pretty simple setup. You have two options:

You can drop the RAGE_MAP_ADDON.PBO into your server's @ExileServer/addons folder and start that puppy up!
Unpack the RAGE_MAP_ADDON.PBO and edit the globaldefines.hpp. Each area of map content can be switched off or on from there. Repack that RAGE_MAP_ADDON.PBO, drop it into the @ExileServer/addons folder of your server. Then start it on up.

# Features:

   Addon will detect which map you are running on your server. If you are running a map for which the addon has content, the addon will add it.
   
   Easy to pick and choose which map content you desire through the globaldefines.hpp.
   
   So freaking easy to install! OMFG! So easy!
   
   Any buildings in the addon are lootable. This has been tested a lot. Because it is kind of pointless to add building that don't spawn loot.
