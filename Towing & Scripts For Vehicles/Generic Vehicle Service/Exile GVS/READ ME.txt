// Before we begin, it is important to know whether you have more than one
// ARMA 3 profile. You will be using the Eden Editor to place markers down
// within your mission pbo (i.e. Exile.Altis). If you place the folders listed
// in the steps below in the wrong location you won't see them in Eden. To get
// a better understanding of what I am talking about see Eden section in my guide.

***You may need to create folders if they do not already exist****

Step 1: Copy the folders in the "compositions" folder into your own.
Note: Located in your: MyDocuments > ARMA 3 or MyDocuments > ARMA 3 - Other Profiles > "Profile"

Step 2: DePbo your mission pbo and place in your "missions" folder.
Note: Notice I said "missions" and not "mpmissions".

Step 3: Open your mission.sqm located within your mission (i.e. Exile.Altis\mission.sqm).
Note: If you are not already using NotePad++ shame on you....use it!

Step 4: Copy anything listed in the block "addons[]=" into a separate text document. Example below:
		
		addons[]=
		{
			"exile_client",
			"CUP_Editor_Structures_Config",
			"CUP_Editor_Buildings_Config",
			"CUP_Misc3_Config",
			"CUP_Misc_e_Config",
			"A3_Structures_F_Items_Vessels",
			"A3_Structures_F_EPA_Mil_Scrapyard",
			"A3_Ui_F",	
			"extendedbase"
		};
		
Note: If you load your "initServer.sqf" serverside using "a3_custom.pbo" or "a3_custom_buildings.pbo" 
you can skip this step. If you have no idea what I am talking about then it won't hurt to do this.

Step 5: Open your mission in Eden Editor. Press F2 and click on the far right icon "Custom".
Note: You may have an option to "IMPORT" instead of open. Don't panic go ahead import.

Step 6: Place the compositions down for each service point as you desire. Save once you are done.
Note: You can change the marker types and colors if you wish. Just ensure that you DON'T change the names.

Step 7: Verify that the addons in Step 4 match your addons after saving. If not copy over them with original.
Note: If you don't get this right bad things could happen.

Step 8: Open the "description.ext" provided in download and follow steps within.
Note: This is located within the "missions" folder of the download.

Step 9: Open the "init.sqf" provided in download and follow steps within.

Final Step: Copy the "gvs" folder provided into your own mission and RePbo. YOU ARE DONE!!
