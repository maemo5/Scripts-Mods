# Information

This software will automatically read the "scripts.log" file, create exceptions from the restriction info, and add those exceptions to the "scripts.txt" file.
This software WILL NOT add exceptions to any other kind of ArmA BattlEye filters (those should always be handled manually).
Also, this software does not (yet) refresh your server's filters, so you will need to do those manually. However, it does have mechanisms to prevent duplicate exceptions from being added into your filters.


## NOTES:
* This will ONLY work on Windows. If people want a Linux version, feel free to compile it from the source. It also requires the Visual Studio C++ 2012 Redistributable. However, if you're running an Exile server (with extDB2), you should have it already.
* I know it's not the brightest idea to download a random exe from the internet and run it on your computer (and especially a rented dedicated server). Least of all right inside of your BattlEye folder where your RCON password and all of your filters are, so I included the source code "be_aeg.cpp". Compiler information in ReadMe.
* This tool will ONLY write exceptions for SCRIPT FILTERS. I decided AGAINST adding support for other restrictions because those should, in my opinion,Â be handled manually because you need to know what's happening. Perhaps, if there's enough demand, I will add the ability to generate exceptions for other restrictions (and it will have to be enabled manually).
* I would suggest "reloading scripts" whenever an exception is added. As mentioned above, the tool does have mechanisms in place to prevent duplicate exceptions from being added, but it'd be smarter still reload scripts periodically. I may eventually update the tool to automatically reload filters whenever exceptions are added.
* I also recommend that you replace all of the "7"s in the beginning of your scripts.txt with "1"s for initial generation on a CLOSED test server. I would NOT advise you to use this tool on a live server for obvious reasons.
* You can specify launch parameters for this tool! Check the [advanced instructions](https://github.com/eraser1/BE_AEG#advanced-instructions) for details.
* This tool is not exclusive to Exile, or even ArmA 3! It "should" work even in ArmA 2.



#### Compiler information
The executable was compiled using "Microsoft Visual Studio (Ultimate) 2012" on "Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit". The executable was compiled for WINDOWS and the source code has NOT been tested on a Linux environment.



# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Place the "BE_AEG.exe" executable in your server's "BattlEye" folder (NEXT TO YOUR SCRIPTS.TXT and SCRIPTS.LOG).
2. Run the "BE_AEG.exe" executable (eg by double-clicking, command line, or via batch file).
3. Generate scripts exceptions! They will be automatically added. You can (should) also reload your script restrictions every time an exception is added.
4. Close the console window whenever you're done.


## ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS:
This software supports the use of certain command line parameters.
These parameters must be separated by (at least) a spacebar. These parameters are CASE SENSITIVE.
Refer to the two provided batch files for a small example.

Supported parameters:
* noScriptLogBackup - This will prevent the program from backing up your script logs into the "BE_AEG_scripts.log" file.
* noLogs - This will prevent the program from writing logs to "BE_AutoExceptionGenerator.log".
* enableDebugConsole - This will cause the program to write debug information to the console. (Keep in mind that the console will NOT produce the same information as the logs)
* runOnce - This will cause the program to only generate a single set of exceptions, based on what is in the "scripts.log" file at launch.
