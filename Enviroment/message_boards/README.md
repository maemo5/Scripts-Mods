# Live scoreboard / messageboard for Exile Mod

## Description
I wanted to create a live scoreboard for Altis Life a few years back but i never managed to find a suitable way so it can work live in game and it wont hurt perfomance bad. Recently i discovered a GitHub hosted package by https://github.com/Cenwulf which pointed me in the right direction to create my scoreboard. I consulted with a few very bright guys in the Arma 3 scripting discord channel which helped me get the script optimized and once i got it to a level that i like i used it on 2 of our Neutralgaming servers. I was pleasantly surprised the excitement these boards created for the players and i saw an aspect of Exile i haven't seen before. Everyone was pushing hard to be the top on each board except the deaths board of course. So i decided that this is something all of you Exile server hosts should get and use and enjoy.   

 - When you see `##arma_3_server##` that refers to the root directory of your Arma 3 setup.
 - When you see `##exile_mission##` that refers to the folder name of your mission

## Installation Fresh
- Convert the `exile_ng` folder into a PBO using PBO manager and copy the PBO into into ##arma_3_server##/@ExileServer/addons/
- Open `exile.ini` file and copy all the text and paste it right at the bottom of your `##arma3server##/@ExileServer/extDB/sql_custom_v2/exile.ini`
- Copy the textures folder to your `##arma_3_server##/mpmissions/##exile_mission##/` if you already have a textures folder than just copy the contents of my textures folder into yours
- Open clientside_code/config.cpp and copy all the text and paste it at the bottom of your `##arma_3_server##/mpmissions/##exile_mission##/config.cpp`
- Open your map editor and place the standard `Land_Billboard_F` billboard where you would like the live scoreboard to initialize and export them using the Exile tools for exporting map objects. The exported lines will contain object similar to the following:
```
["Land_Billboard_F", [8066.36, 9722.94, 31.9463], [1, -4.37114e-008, 0], [0, 0, 1], true],
["Land_Billboard_F", [3628.18, 3212.83, 4.30319], [-0.200219, -0.979751, 0], [0, 0, 1], true],
```
These two lines will go in your initServer.sqf with the rest of the object that you have with your mission. That will ensure that the billboards are spawned when your mission initializes.
- Copy the coordinates from the placed billboards and update the settings you put under `##arma_3_server##/mpmissions/##exile_mission##/config.cpp` and make sure that the last part of each coordinate is set to 0. Exile exports the coords in ASL (At sea level) fashion and my script is trying to locate them in a ATL (At terrain level). The script will use these coordinates to locate the objects so it can initialize the scoreboards on them.

## TODOs
I would love to utilize the try catch blocks properly as they are designed but i wanted to get it live so people can enjoy. I will release an update as i go and than it will be a matter of copy paste the new files to get it going
