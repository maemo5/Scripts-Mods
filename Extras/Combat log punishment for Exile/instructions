Worked with @StokesMagee to bring combat logging punishment to Exile.
This will kick in and kill the combat logger if they leave the game whilst in combat, either through alt+f4 or end mission, leaving their lifeless corpse there to loot.
Players cannot logout normally whilst in combat as the option is blocked in escape menu

CLIENT
Pull ExileClient_gui_hud_toggleCombatIcon.sqf from client files into your mission file and change it to the following:-

private["_display", "_icon"];
disableSerialization;
_display = uiNamespace getVariable "RscExileHUD";
_icon = _display displayCtrl 1008;
if (_this && {!(player getVariable ["ExileIsInCombat", false])}) then
{
    player setVariable ["ExileIsInCombat", true, true];
}
else
{
    if (!(_this) && {player getVariable["ExileIsInCombat", false]}) then
    {
        player setVariable ["ExileIsInCombat", nil, true];
    };
};
_icon ctrlShow _this;
true
What this does is set a variable on the player that can be read from the server
Don't forget to add it into config.cpp in

class CfgExileCustomCode
{
	ExileClient_gui_hud_toggleCombatIcon = "ExileClient_gui_hud_toggleCombatIcon.sqf";//assuming changed file is in mission root
};
SERVER
Next, replace ExileServer_system_network_event_onHandleDisconnect.sqf with https://pastebin.com/gv0QhFD8
Note: Uncomment the lines marked for logging if you have infiSTAR

 

Then repack exile_server and your mission file and you're done.
Updated: Added Toast request 7/11/17
Updated: Check if server is about to restart and not punish the player 28/05/18
